## Overview

Welcome to our Antiyoy-inspired strategy game! This project is a turn-based strategy game where players compete to control as much territory as possible. Our game integrates Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to provide a challenging AI opponent.

## Features

- Turn-based strategy gameplay
- Q-learning powered AI opponent
- Procedurally generated maps
- Multiple difficulty levels

## How to Play

1. **Start a New Game**: Launch the game and select 'New Game' from the main menu.
2. **Choose Your Settings**: Customize your game settings such as map size, number of players, and difficulty level.
3. **Gameplay**: Take turns to move your units and conquer territories. The goal is to control as much territory as possible and eliminate your opponents.
4. **AI Opponent**: The AI opponent uses Q-learning to adapt its strategy based on the state of the game.

## Q-Learning Integration

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique used in our game to create a smart AI opponent. The AI learns from its actions and improves its strategy over time. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **State**: The current configuration of the game board.
- **Action**: The possible moves the AI can make.
- **Reward**: The feedback received after making a move (positive for good moves, negative for bad moves).
- **Q-Table**: A table where the AI stores the expected rewards for each state-action pair.
